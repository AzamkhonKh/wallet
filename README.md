## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET SDK
* Docker (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wallet-net.git # Replace with the actual repository URL
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd wallet-net
   ```
3. **Database Setup:**
   - This project uses PostgreSQL as its database.
   - Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running.
   - Update the connection string in `appsettings.json` (and `appsettings.Development.json` if needed) with your PostgreSQL credentials:
     ```json
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=your_db_name;Username=your_username;Password=your_password"
     }
     ```
   - The application will automatically apply database migrations upon startup.

4. Restore .NET dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Using .NET CLI

1.  **Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running and the connection string in `appsettings.json` is correctly configured.**
2.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    The API will be available at `https://localhost:7000` or `http://localhost:5000` (check your console output). Database migrations will be applied automatically on startup.

#### Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Docker users)

This is the easiest way to get started with Docker as it sets up both the application and a PostgreSQL database container.

1.  **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.**
2.  Navigate to the project root directory (where `docker-compose.yaml` is located).
3.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This command will:
    * Build the `wallet-net` application image (if not already built).
    * Create and run a PostgreSQL container. The data will be persisted in a Docker volume.
    * Create and run the `wallet-net` application container, linking it to the PostgreSQL container.
4.  The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in `docker-compose.yaml`).

    To stop the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

#### Using Docker (Manual Build and Run)

This method requires you to manage the database separately.

1.  **Ensure Docker is installed.**
2.  **Set up a PostgreSQL database accessible to Docker.** You can run PostgreSQL in a Docker container or use an existing instance. Make sure to update the `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` in `appsettings.json` to point to this database instance *before* building the image, or manage this configuration using environment variables when running the container.
3.  Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t wallet-net .
    ```
4.  Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 \
           -e ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection="Host=<your_postgres_host>;Port=5432;Database=<your_db>;Username=<your_user>;Password=<your_pass>" \
           wallet-net
    ```
    Replace `<your_postgres_host>`, `<your_db>`, `<your_user>`, and `<your_pass>` with your actual database details. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoints

This section details the available API endpoints.

### General Notes:
*   **Base URL:** All API routes are prefixed with `/api`.
*   **Authentication:** Many endpoints require a JWT Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. These are marked with `ðŸ”’`.
*   **Error Responses:**
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Typically indicates invalid input, missing parameters, or failed validation. The response body often contains details about the errors.
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required, and it has failed or has not been provided.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: Authentication was successful, but the authenticated user does not have permission to access the resource.
    *   `404 Not Found`: The requested resource does not exist.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

### User Controller
**Base Route:** `/api/user`

Manages user accounts.
*Security Warning: The endpoints in this controller currently lack `[Authorize]` attributes. This is a significant security risk as it would allow unauthenticated access to user data and management functions. This should be addressed by adding appropriate authorization.*

1.  **`GET /api/user`**
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a list of all users.
    *   **Authorization:** None (Potential security risk - exposes all user data).
    *   **Response (200 OK):** An array of `User` objects.
        *   Each `User` object includes: `id` (int), `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `userName`, `createdAt`, `isEmailVerified`, and other properties inherited from `IdentityUser`.
        *   *Note: Exposing the full `User` model, especially fields like `otpCode`, `passwordHash` (from IdentityUser), is a security concern. A `UserDTO` should be used for responses.*
        ```json
        [
          { "id": 1, "firstName": "Admin", "lastName": "User", "email": "admin@example.com", ... },
          { "id": 2, "firstName": "Jane", "lastName": "Doe", "email": "jane@example.com", ... }
        ]
        ```

2.  **`GET /api/user/{id}`**
    *   **Description:** Retrieves a specific user by their `int` ID.
    *   **Authorization:** None (Potential security risk).
    *   **Path Parameter:** `id` (int) - The integer ID of the user.
    *   **Response (200 OK):** The `User` object (see structure above).
    *   **Response (404 Not Found):** If the user does not exist.

3.  **`PUT /api/user/{id}`**
    *   **Description:** Updates an existing user.
    *   **Authorization:** None (Potential security risk - allows unauthenticated updates).
    *   **Path Parameter:** `id` (int) - The integer ID of the user to update.
    *   **Request Body:** `User` object.
        *   *Note: Client should send only fields intended for update. Backend should carefully control which fields can be updated.*
        ```json
        {
          "id": 2, // Must match {id} in path
          "firstName": "Janet",
          // ... other updatable fields
        }
        ```
    *   **Response (204 No Content):** On successful update.
    *   **Response (400 Bad Request):** If `id` in body doesn't match `id` in path.
    *   **Response (404 Not Found):** If the user does not exist.

4.  **`DELETE /api/user/{id}`**
    *   **Description:** Deletes a user by their `int` ID.
    *   **Authorization:** None (Potential security risk - allows unauthenticated deletions).
    *   **Path Parameter:** `id` (int) - The integer ID of the user to delete.
    *   **Response (204 No Content):** On successful deletion.
    *   **Response (404 Not Found):** If the user does not exist.
